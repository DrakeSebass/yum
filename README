My yum.repos.d directories for CentOS.

Goals here:
  * direct my CentOS servers/workstations at my own mirrors
  * include 3rd party repos (RPMForge crew mostly)
  * enabled/disable my own approved parts of the sources
  * install a few packages I feel are required

Installing the repo:
  * git clone
