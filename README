yum.repos.d directories for CentOS (and perhaps others)

Goals here:
  * direct my CentOS servers/workstations at my own mirrors
  * include 3rd party repos (RPMForge crew mostly)
  * enabled/disable my own approved parts of the sources
  * install a few packages I feel are required

Installing the repo:
  * pick a pull method:
    > git clone http://github.com/dayne/yum.git
    > svn co http://svn.github.com/dayne/yum
  * go to the appropriate distro version (RHEL5 example:)
    > cd yum/centos5
  * install the yum.repos.d
    > ./install.sh
